# seqr-mobile-translations

This repository contains the translations files for [SEQR Mobile App](https://dhiway.com/seqr).

We have linked this up with [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=Ij5xDQ3rhR), please join there and feel free to edit.

## How to contribute

It is advised that you install [Dhiway's SEQR App](https://dhiway.com/seqr) first. Get a feel for the app by Scanning few QR codes you encounter. That would help you to understand the grouping of messages in the files here.

All translations are present in `locale/` directory. The files inside are created in a key value type of manner (`.json` format). Make sure that you are not altering `key` in any of your translation, as the keys are used in the code to pick the corresponding translation.
