# seqr-mobile-translations

This repository contains the translations files for [SEQR Mobile App](https://dhiway.com/seqr).

We have linked this up with [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/) too, if you wish to contribute

## How to contribute

It is advised that you install [Dhiway's SEQR App](https://dhiway.com/seqr) first. Get a feel for the app by Scanning few QR codes you encounter. That would help you to understand the grouping of messages in the files here.

All translations are present in `locale/` directory. The files inside are created in a key value type of manner (`.csv` format). Make sure that you are not altering `key` in any of your translation, as the keys are used in the code to pick the corresponding translation.


### New translation

Pick a language you want to contribute. Pick a language you would like to translate. Copy the `English.csv` file as `YourLanguage.csv` file. Provide translations to as many keys as possible.


### Making edits

If there is already a translation exists for the language you want to contribute, do check in the file, and see if it can be improved further.
